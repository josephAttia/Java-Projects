The Great Scale Mutator Lab

Make sure your sound is on.

Navigate to the ScaleMutator_SHELL folder
Open up scaleMutator.java and scaleMutatorDriver.java

Complete the methods in scaleMutator, and test them by running ScaleMutatorDriver

NOTE:
if you want to write your scale out to a MIDI file, it will create it in the same folder as this lab.
You can play the MIDI file from most media players.
You can not write out to a MIDI file if one of the same name is already opened in a media player.

For those that do not want graphics, a text only version is available in:

text version/scaleMutatorSHELL.java 

For the extra credit sequence, I have created the Music Sketchpad, which can be unzipped and run.
It will give you a place to draw and hear notes to arrange in a sequence that you can then program for extra credit
in the ScaleMutator.  The extra credit sequence must be done by cleverly arranging loops, as opposed to hard coding
each element of the array to specific notes.
